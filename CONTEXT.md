# Commodity Dashboard Context

## Purpose

This repo is currently being used to build a **local commodity dashboard** backed by a **static local SQLite database**.

The active goal is:

- use the May 2026 snapshot as a fixed development dataset
- serve a local dashboard without Google Sheets dependencies
- keep the dataset read-only during the current phase
- implement the search-first dashboard flow from the wireframes

This repo is **not** operating as a live sync pipeline right now.

## Current Source of Truth

The current source workbook is:

- `Agro Dashboard - new data.xlsx`

That workbook is converted into the local SQLite database:

- `data/agro_dashboard.db`

Rebuild command:

- `npm run build:static-db`

## Current Architecture

Current development shape:

- `Agro Dashboard - new data.xlsx` -> `data/agro_dashboard.db` -> `local-dashboard/server.js` -> browser UI
- `Agro Dashboard - new data.xlsx` -> `data/agro_dashboard.db` -> `scripts/build_pages_site.js` -> `docs/` static site

Current runtime commands:

- `npm run build:static-db`
- `npm run dashboard:local`
- `npm run build:pages`

The local dashboard is served at:

- `http://127.0.0.1:3180`

The static GitHub Pages-style build is generated into:

- `docs/`

## Active Assumptions

The dataset is static for the current phase.

That means:

- no inserts
- no updates
- no deletes
- no rolling retention
- no live Google Sheets sync

If the workbook changes, the database is rebuilt from scratch.

## Main Files

- `scrape_krama.js`
  Legacy KRAMA scraper from the earlier Sheets-based workflow. Not part of the active local dashboard path.

## Database Model

The SQLite database is normalized for clean reads.

### Core tables

- `commodities`
- `commodity_mapping`
- `districts`
- `markets`
- `market_district_mapping`
- `varieties`
- `grades`
- `units`
- `price_observations`
- `scrape_runs`
- `source_snapshot`

### Read-focused views

- `price_observations_flat`
  Denormalized view for dashboard reads

- `latest_price_observations`
  Latest available row per `commodity + market + variety + grade`

## Imported Dataset Summary

Current static snapshot:

- `price_observations`: 20,041 rows
- `commodity_mapping`: 133 rows
- `districts`: 31 rows
- `market_district_mapping`: 163 rows
- `scrape_runs`: 45 rows
- 133 commodities
- 163 markets
- 236 varieties
- 6 grades
- report dates from `2026-05-02` through `2026-05-31`

## Data Semantics

The workbook includes three logical datasets:

- `prices`
- `commodity_mapping`
- `runs`

They were mapped into SQLite as:

- `prices` -> `price_observations` plus dimension tables
- `commodity_mapping` -> `commodity_mapping`
- `runs` -> `scrape_runs`
- district geography -> `districts` and `market_district_mapping`

Active row-level fields used in the dashboard:

1. `row_key`
2. `report_date`
3. `heading`
4. `commodity`
5. `perishability`
6. `market`
7. `variety`
8. `grade`
9. `arrivals`
10. `unit`
11. `min_price`
12. `max_price`
13. `modal_price`
14. `scraped_at`

The flattened read view now also includes:

1. `district`
2. `district_slug`

## Implemented Dashboard Flow

The current dashboard follows the wireframe direction as a **search-first flow**.

### Home screen

The home screen currently includes:

- dashboard branding/header
- global search bar
- interactive Karnataka district map

Search remains the active primary navigation path, but the district map is now wired into the home screen.

### Search behavior

The global search supports:

- commodity search
- market search
- variety search

Search result priority:

1. commodity
2. market
3. variety

Search result labeling:

- `Tomato (Commodity)`
- `Mysuru (Market)`
- `Local (Tomato)`

Variety results are always shown in the form:

- `Variety (Commodity)`

### Results page behavior

There is one shared results view with pre-applied context.

#### Commodity search

- locked heading: commodity
- filters: market, variety

#### Market search

- locked heading: market
- filters: commodity, variety

#### Variety search

- locked headings: commodity and variety
- filter: market

### Filters

Filters are cascading.

That means:

- only valid combinations are shown
- impossible combinations are not available in dropdowns

The current filter UI on the results page uses a floating filter action button instead of always-visible inline controls.

Clicking that button opens a popup with:

- only the filters relevant to the current table context
- typed search within each filter field
- multi-select results
- selected values shown as removable chips
- explicit `Apply Filters`
- `Clear Filters`

The popup uses staged draft selections, so table results only change after `Apply Filters` is clicked.

### Geography layer

The local DB now includes a district geography layer used by the home-screen map.

Current structure:

- `districts`
  current Karnataka district list used by the local dashboard

- `market_district_mapping`
  one market-to-district assignment for each market in the static dataset

This mapping now supports:

- district click -> market pins for that district
- market pin click -> route to the market table

Most mappings follow district/taluk geography directly. A small number of market names were normalized or inferred because the workbook uses abbreviated or inconsistent labels, for example:

- `ENDI` -> treated as `Indi` in Vijayapura district
- `YARAHALLI` -> mapped to the APMC yard reference in H. D. Kote taluk, Mysuru district

### Results card behavior

The current results surface shows:

- the latest row only for each exact `commodity + market + variety + grade` combination after applying the selected context and active filters
- results sorted by `market`
- one full-width card per result on both mobile and desktop
- context-aware primary headings inside each card:
  - market search -> commodity is primary
  - commodity search -> market is primary
  - variety search -> market is primary, with variety and grade grouped below
- grouped card sections for:
  - identity
  - prices
  - arrivals / units
  - price updates

Card content currently includes:

- a single top-line anchor value only, with no extra `Market` / `Commodity` label above it
- `Arrivals And Units`
- price labels with rupee units:
  - `Max Price (Rs.)`
  - `Min Price (Rs.)`
  - `Modal Price (Rs.)`
- a single `Price Updates` block with:
  - `Latest`
  - `Previous`

Current card layout details:

- the anchor value on the first line is shown alone as the strongest card heading
- `Variety` and `Grade` sit beneath that heading
- `Arrivals And Units` is rendered as a compact two-column row:
  - field label on the left
  - value right-aligned on the same row
- `Price Updates` shows `Latest` and `Previous` side by side
- the results view header uses `Showing Results For` plus larger locked context chips

The results UI also currently uses:

- tighter mobile padding than the earlier prototype
- only locked context chips at the top of the results view, with no duplicate black heading text
- a top-left `Home` button beside the language toggle area
- a floating filter action button with an onboarding hint animation

For each result card, the price block also shows the absolute change from the previous comparable update for the exact:

- `commodity + market + variety + grade`

Delta behavior:

- increase -> green rising indicator with `+value`
- decrease -> red falling indicator with `-value`
- no change -> `0`
- no earlier comparable row -> `No earlier update`

Both date values use `DD-MM-YYYY`.

### Card expansion

Clicking `See Price History` expands an **inline history panel inside the card** for the exact:

- `commodity + market + variety + grade`

The history panel shows:

- min price
- max price
- modal price
- fixed visual mapping:
  - max price -> `#1E3A8A` solid line
  - min price -> `#C2410C` solid line
  - modal price -> `#CC9900` dotted line
- point markers for each plotted date
- latest date active by default when the chart opens
- hover/tap selection for any plotted date
- an in-chart value tooltip plus a compact summary block for the selected date
- x-axis dates in `DD-MM`
- tooltip and selected-date displays in `DD-MM-YYYY`
- horizontal scrolling isolated to the graph area only
- a `Last 7 days` / `Last 30 days` bubble aligned at the top-right of the expanded panel
- a small note above the graph telling users to scroll horizontally to see all dates

Current interaction details:

- the chart no longer eagerly selects points on `touchstart`
- mobile horizontal swipes are now interpreted as scroll first, making dense charts easier to navigate
- chart horizontal scroll position is preserved while the same card stays expanded
- chart horizontal scroll resets only on first expansion or after collapse and reopen
- the selected-point summary below the graph is arranged as:
  - `Max` left aligned
  - `Min` right aligned
  - `Modal` centered on the next row

When multiple series overlap, all three remain visible. The chart draws `max` last so it stays visually strongest without hiding `min` or `modal`.

### Hardcoded history windows

History window is determined by perishability and is not user-selectable:

- perishable -> last 7 days
- non-perishable -> last 30 days

## Current API Surface

The local server currently exposes:

- `/api/health`
- `/api/map`
- `/api/search?q=...`
- `/api/search-index`
- `/api/context?type=commodity&commodity=...`
- `/api/context?type=market&market=...`
- `/api/context?type=variety&commodity=...&variety=...`

### API responsibilities

- `/api/search`
  returns prioritized search results

- `/api/search-index`
  returns the raw commodity, market, and variety catalog used for client-side bilingual search matching

- `/api/map`
  returns district-level market mapping for the home-screen map

- `/api/context`
  returns table context metadata and all matching rows for the selected search type

- `/api/health`
  simple server + DB health check

## Current UI Status

Implemented and working:

- local server
- static Pages build generated into `docs/`
- home screen
- search suggestion flow
- route into shared results page
- locked context headings
- cascading filters
- custom filter dropdown menus contained within the card on mobile
- floating filter action button on the table screen
- popup-based staged multi-select filters with typed search, removable chips, explicit apply, and clear actions
- latest-row-only results cards
- card price deltas against the previous comparable update
- inline card expansion
- inline price history chart
- selected-point chart tooltip and summary values
- interactive district map on the home screen
- district click-to-zoom using SVG `viewBox` focus
- manual map panning inside the map container
- touch pinch-to-zoom and wheel-based zoom adjustments on the map
- district-scoped market pins rendered inside the selected district
- market pin click -> market table route
- mobile-friendly stacked layout for home and results pages
- tighter mobile padding on cards and controls for the results screen
- chart horizontal scroll preserved when selecting a different chart point
- local district and market geography used by the home-screen map
- English/Kannada toggle persisted in browser storage
- translated commodity, market, and variety labels across suggestions, headings, filters, table cells, history titles, and map market labels
- bilingual search matching so Kannada and English input both resolve while results render in the active language

Not implemented yet:

- additional summary widgets
- movers / top-changes module
- production packaging for the local dashboard

## Known Decisions

### Chosen

- use SQLite as the active datastore
- use the workbook as the rebuild source
- keep the current dataset static
- build a local Node-served HTML dashboard
- generate a GitHub Pages-friendly static build from the same source UI
- make search the primary navigation path
- keep row history inline in the results cards
- use the local district map as a secondary navigation path from home

### Not chosen

- live Google Sheets reads
- write-through editing in the local app
- direct Excel reads from the browser
- giant JSON as the primary source of truth
- latest-row-only results-card behavior for the current search-driven build

## Historical Context

This repo originally supported a different workflow:

- scrape KRAMA data
- write to Google Sheets
- manage perishability through Apps Script
- serve a dashboard from Apps Script HTML

That older workflow still exists in the codebase as reference, but it is **not the active architecture now**.

Reference-only files from that workflow:

- `scrape_krama.js`
- `scripts/backfill_perishability.js`
- `appscript/Code.gs`
- `appscript/CommodityMapping.html`
- `appscript/Dashboard.html`

## Operational Notes

- rebuild the DB whenever the workbook changes:
  - `npm run build:static-db`

- start the local dashboard server with:
  - `npm run dashboard:local`

- build the static Pages bundle with:
  - `npm run build:pages`

- DB path:
  - `data/agro_dashboard.db`

- for simple row reads, prefer:
  - `price_observations_flat`

- for latest-row-per-entry reads, prefer:
  - `latest_price_observations`

## Current Map Notes

The active home-screen map now uses:

- `local-dashboard/public/karnataka-geo.svg`

That SVG is now sourced from a better district map asset copied from the locally cloned `karnataka-budget-expectations` repo.

The map now supports:

- district click
- district zoom
- manual panning inside the map viewport
- touch pinch zoom and pointer/wheel zoom without changing the existing district-selection flow
- market-pin generation from `market_district_mapping`
- in-SVG labeled market markers placed from district geometry sampling
- market pin click -> market table navigation
- direct district-path click handling on the integrated SVG asset
- zoom in / zoom out / reset controls based on the active SVG `viewBox`

Current source limitation:

- the current SVG source contains `30` districts, not `31`
- `Ramanagara` is present
- `Vijayanagara` is not present in the current SVG source, even though it exists in the local DB

## Immediate Next Step

The next practical work is to continue refining the local dashboard UI, expand any remaining localization coverage beyond commodity, market, and variety names if needed, and iterate on the card/history experience as more mobile usage feedback comes in.
